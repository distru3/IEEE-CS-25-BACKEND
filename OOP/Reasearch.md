# OOP Research

## task 1

- **who invent OOP and why**

  **Alan Kay**

  it was invented so it makes code easily reusable and to maintaniable and helped avoid the redundency that a code might have by the use of objects and such.

- **Encapsulation & Abstraction**

  **Encapsultion** is the concept of binding data and methods and preventing it from unauthorized access. It wraps up data and functions under a single unit. Another way to think about encapsulation is, that it is a protective shield that prevents the data from being accessed by the code outside this shield

  **Abstraction** is the property by virtue of which only the essential details are displayed to the user. The trivial or the non-essential units are not displayed to the user. Ex: A car is viewed as a car rather than its individual components. Data Abstraction may also be defined as the process of identifying only the required characteristics of an object ignoring the irrelevant details. The properties and behaviors of an object differentiate it from other objects of similar type and also help in classifying/grouping the objects.

- **Inheritance**

  say you have a family, in that family is a grandpa, a dad and a child, that child has some facial features from his dad who got them from his granddpa, while also having features from his dad that he didn't get from his grandpa, while also having features niether his dad or his grandpa has, this in or day to day normal life is called **inheritance**, it's the concept of having a new member of some kind get features from an already exicting member (that acts as the parent if we compare it to the real life concept) this can be applied to classes,
  a class can inherite featres from classes relating to it weather it's some methods or variables or any kinds of data while also allowing that class to have some features of its own.

- **PHP Interfaces & Polymorphism**

  An **interface** in PHP is a blueprint for a class that enforces certain methods to be implemented by any class that uses it. Interfaces help in achieving abstraction and multiple inheritance (since PHP does not support multiple inheritance using classes)

  **Polymorphism** means "many forms." In PHP, it allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common interface or parent class, making code more flexible and reusable.

- **PHP Traits**

  Traits are a mechanism for code reuse in single inheritance languages such as PHP. A Trait is intended to reduce some limitations of single inheritance by enabling a developer to reuse sets of methods freely in several independent classes living in different class hierarchies. The semantics of the combination of Traits and classes is defined in a way which reduces complexity, and avoids the typical problems associated with multiple inheritance and Mixins.

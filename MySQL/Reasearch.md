- **"What is Database and why does it exist?":**

  when we think of what is a Database the first thing that comes to mind is information, it is basically a place to store any kind of information, maintaining it, and accessing it.

  > Databases are structured collections of data organized into tables, rows, and columns. Databases serve as repositories for storing information efficiently and provide a way to manage and access data.

  they are vital so we can store data from different kinds, data for organizations or such, so that important data, lets say like customer data, product data, and other stuff for an e-commerce website for example are kept in a safe place, so that it can be accessed and have operations done upon them using different dbms's.

- **"What is the SQL?":**

  SQL (or Structured Query Language) is a programing language that is standardized for managing and manipulating relational databases so basically we can't think of a database without thinking of SQL. with SQL you can do all kinds of operations on a database, weather it's just retrieving it's content, or changing it in some type of way

- **"What is the history of MySQL?":**

  MySQL was founded by Swedes David Axmark and Allan Larsson, along with Finnish Michael "Monty" Widenius by a Swedish company called "MySQL AB". Developement for it began in 1994 and by 23rd of may 1995 the first version released it was created for personal use rather than mSQL which was considered slow and inflexable by them(MySQL AB) at the time, creating a new interface while still keeping the same API as mSQL, this of course allowed developers to migrate to MySQL easier. from the day it released to this day the developers keep on improving upon MySQL and in 2019 MySQL was declared DBMS of the year by DB-Engines ranking, proving its worth in managing databases

- **"What are the most 5 famous DBs in the world now?and why?":**

there are many rankings to differant db's but here is what i found to be the most fitting by [swhosting.com](https://www.swhosting.com/en/blog/the-5-most-widely-used-databases-worldwide-which-is-the-best-choice-for-my-project)

1. **Oracle:**
   it is one of the oldest and most used relational databases in the business world, it is well known to be highly scalable, secure and reliable so it's no wonder for it being popular among large enterprises and governments, it has all the basic data management features along side the richest features for data security

2. **MySQL:**
   MySQL's popularity stems mainly from it being open-source and having high performance,reliability and ease of use, we can see MySQL in popular web apps like Facebook and X.com (twitter, before elon musk ruined everything(as if it wasn't ruined already))and Youtube.

3. **Microsoft SQL Server:**
   mainly popular due to it"s integration of other microsoft tools like .NET framework and VS, it has many advanced features that make it standout from other db's

4. **PostgreSQL:**
   this is another open-source RDB it has earned a strong reputation for its achtecture, reliability, data integrity and many more. It comes with many features aimed to help developers build applications, administrators to protect data integrity and build fault-tolerant environments, and help you manage your data no matter how big or small the dataset.

5. **MongoDB:**
   a document oriented NoSQL database that became popular among web and mobile app development, it stands out from other RDB's for it's use of the flexable JSON documents which facilitates scalability and adaptability to changes in the data schema
